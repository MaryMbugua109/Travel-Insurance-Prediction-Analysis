# Travel-Insurance-Prediction-Analysis
## Context
A Tour and Travel Agency wants to  better cater to their market and stand out from the rest of the competition. An ideal way that gives them a competitive edge is by offering an insurance cover(with a COVID cover) that protects its customers from various risks encountered during the journey some of which may include: lost baggage, medical expenses, flight cancellations and other losses. The challenge that the agency encounters despite having this brilliant strategy is whether or not their consumers will take the insurance policies. Our research aims to tackle this challenge by building a predictive model that can predict whether a customer will buy the travel insurance package or not.
